# Log

Curated history (notable changes, decisions); release notes stay in GitHub Releases.

## 2026-08-07
- Adopted the Krateo Documentation Standard (this bundle): thin README, the invariant
  docs/ nine, `examples/github-repo`, regenerated CRD reference, dead-org purge.

## 2026-08-04 — 0.20.0
- `global.imageRegistry` chart value: one registry override for the provider and RDC
  images (mirror / air-gapped installs) (#56).
- CI consolidation: canonical `release-oci.yaml` publishes both charts on tag (#57),
  shared reusable multi-platform image build (#58, #59), obsolete crds→chart-repo
  publish job dropped (#60) — the charts live in this repo now.

## 2026-08-02 — 0.19.0
- apiKey-in-header authentication: the generated Configuration CRD gains
  `authentication.apiKey` (`tokenRef` + `header` + optional `valuePrefix`); unsupported
  security schemes now fail CRD generation instead of being skipped silently (#49).
  Joint contract with rest-dynamic-controller 0.19.0 (the chart pin).

## 2026-08-01 — 0.18.0
- `async.poll.handleParam`: bind the extracted operation handle to a vendor-named path
  parameter (e.g. Aruba's `.../monitor/{id}`) without patching the OAS; poll `path` is
  validated up front (#48). Requires RDC ≥ 0.18.0.
- Object-form `additionalProperties` (typed free-form maps) carried through to the
  generated schema (#45/#47).

## 2026-07-30 — 0.15.x–0.17.0
- 0.17.0: `requestTransform` accepted again now that RDC executes it (#44) — it had been
  deliberately rejected at admission while unimplemented (#42).
- Engine fold: oasgen-provider became a monorepo — `go/oasgen-provider` +
  `go/rest-dynamic-controller` + `helm/` charts, matrix build/test (#54); Go module
  identity migrated to `github.com/krateo-platformops/*` (#53).
- Tests now gate releases and run on pushes to main (#40); the crds-subchart
  `CHART_VERSION` placeholder is preserved by the CRD-sync job (#39).
- 0.15.0: the never-used `apiLookup` FieldResolver kind removed (see the design notes in
  `types.go`); `[?key=value]` array predicates documented in fieldMapping paths;
  `manifests/` (a non-shipping second copy of the RDC templates) deleted — the chart's
  `assets/rdc/` is the single copy.

## 2026-07 — 0.12.0–0.14.x
- `FieldResolver` (secretRef) on fieldMapping entries; dynamic watch on the generated
  Configuration Kind; auth-secret access migrated off a standing secrets grant onto
  per-namespace, per-Secret RBAC tracked in RestDefinition status.
- Superseded served CRD versions pruned (migration-free version derivation).

## Earlier
- The core KOG design stabilized: RestDefinition → generated resource +
  Configuration CRDs → one rest-dynamic-controller Deployment per RestDefinition,
  rendered from chart-owned templates (mount-and-render, the same mechanism
  core-provider uses for its CDCs).
